# Project-Cafe-Catalog

## Introduction
The following site is still in development: [Cup'O Lounges](http://erikgrootendorst.com).
Please ignore Menu Items / Cafe Items. It's all absolute malarkey right now. Just place holders.

## Functionality To Be Added (non-exhaustive list)

- JSON / API endpoints
- User Auth with OAuth
- Client Auth
- Limiting / request throttling
- CRUD functions:
  * Add cafes / menu items / location
  * Delete cafes / menu items / location
  * Edit cafes / menu items / location
  * Rating System & review postings
- User submission limitations

## Controversial/Possible Add Ons
- Site user accounts (hashes hosted on backend | will coexist with OAuth)
- User confirmation for delete actions

## FIXMEs
- Modify JS alert-margin height to retrieve navbar height. More general purpose var to be used with page anchors.

## Future Issues to Encounter
- As # of items grows, page load times will drastically increase. I'll need to implement a limit load and either load more as user scrolls, or give a 'Load More' option near end of page.
