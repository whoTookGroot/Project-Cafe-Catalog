# Project-Cafe-Catalog

## Introduction
The following site is still in development: [Cup'O Lounges](http://erikgrootendorst.com).
Please ignore Menu Items / Cafe Items. It's all absolute malarkey right now. Just place holders.

## Functionality To Be Added (non-exhaustive list)

- JSON / API endpoints
- User Auth with OAuth
- Client Auth
- Limiting / request throttling
- CRUD functions:
  * Add cafes / menu items / location
  * Delete cafes / menu items / location
  * Edit cafes / menu items / location
  * Rating System & review postings
- User submission limitations

## Controversial Add Ons
- Site user accounts

## FIXMEs
- Link to 'About Us' section. Scrolled too far down from the top of page, placing the header at the very top. Section header is hidden by nav bar when this occurs.
- Modify JS alert-margin height to retrieve navbar height. More general purpose var to be used with page anchors.
